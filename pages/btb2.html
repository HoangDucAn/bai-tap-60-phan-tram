        <h2>Missions</h2>
        <p>We have a lot of catching up to do. Like, a decade's worth. But with missions and rewards like these, we're sure you're up to the task!

            In order to participate, your account must be at least level 5, which you can hit simply by finishing the Tutorial. Each mission will unlock on the given date/time, but will be available to complete until February 21st, 2023 at 3:59PM GMT+8. You can only make progress on one mission within a set at any time, but can make progress in missions across sets. For example, playing on day one will net you points for Week 1: Welcome!, Alpha, AND the first Weekly mission. However, you must finish Week 1: Welcome! before you can start on Week 2: Welcome!</p>
            <h3>Welcome Event Store</h3>
